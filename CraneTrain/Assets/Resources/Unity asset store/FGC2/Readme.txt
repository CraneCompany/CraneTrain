Welcome To The FGC /Freedom's Gate Characters)

********************************************
************** GETTING STARTED *************
********************************************
it's all very easy

1) Download the demo scene that you will find inside the package

2) Start and try first simple animations

3) Test the blendshape.

4) Hair, Props, and Clothing. For add hair and cloth you can use add Item script.

5) I worked a lot on weight-map and for that there is already a good compatibility between the various game-object. If you want you can still use the alpha-texutre that I put in the package. Remember to set the rendering mode of the material character on "Cutout".

5) Video links useful to better understand how it works:
